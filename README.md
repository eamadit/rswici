A real social web implementation to circumvent isolation

Is has been demonstrated that reputed social networks are developped by notorious criminals. It has been demonstrated that web hosting providers do not comply to state-of-the art security standards. This makes most people unable to publish sustainably on the internet. RSWICI allows 10 MB free hosting space to each user and offers gifts once the quality indicator reaches documented steps. A polemic indicator on each website allows the contradictory debate to be brought in front. The social engine is based on a graph and is made for human progress. The news feed is accessible to unsigned users and is openly tailored according to the data leaked by the user with the option to display a standard News Feed version. Public financing is necessary.

RSWICI provides eternal legal archiving with a single mouse click.
